Traffic sign detection with deep neural network. Not yet finished. Plan is to train two neural networks:
1. will deciwe wheter image is a trafic sign and
2. will classify trafic signs.

Datasets downloaded from [btsd.ethz.ch](http://btsd.ethz.ch/shareddata/).

#### Dependencies:
- keras
- sklearn
- numpy
- tensorflow
- scypi
- h5py
